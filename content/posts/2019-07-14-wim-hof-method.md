**1. Get comfortable**

Sit in a meditation posture, whatever is most comfortable for you. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction. It is recommended to do this practice right after waking up, since your stomach is still empty, or before a meal.

**2. 30 power breaths**

Imagine you&#8217;re blowing up a balloon. Inhale through the nose or mouth and exhale through the mouth in short but powerful bursts. Keep a steady pace and use your midriff fully. Close your eyes and do this around 30 times. Symptoms could include light-headedness and/or tingling sensations in the body.

**3. The hold and retention after exhalation**

After the 30 rapid successions of breath cycles, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using any force. Then let the air out and hold for as long as you can without force. Hold the breath until you experience the gasp reflex.

**4. Recovery breath**

Inhale to full capacity. Feel your chest expanding. When you are at full capacity, hold the breath for around 10 seconds and this will be round one. Steps 1&#8211;4 can be repeated three times in succession.

**5. Meditative state**

After having completed the breathing exercise take your time to enjoy the feeling. This feeling will be more and more like a meditation. When you start doing these exercises we recommend to take your time recovering from the breathing exercise. After doing the breathing exercise and when you feel good, you can start with taking the cold shower.

**Warning: important message, please read carefully.**

The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practice the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or light-headedness. If you&#8217;ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.

Do not practise the method during pregnancy or if you have epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.
