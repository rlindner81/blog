There is a common theme to the start of virtually all self-help and self-improvement books. The baseline that is established before you find your particular purpose or passion is always centered around four areas. The more you control these fundamental four the better.

They are listed here in order of "Return On Investment" with respect to your time, so working on them in this order will give you the most bang for your buck.

1. *Sleep*

   Establish a regular sleep pattern of 7&mdash;8 hours. Meaning same bedtime, same wakeup time, also on the weekend.
2. *Nutrition*

   [Nutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition) is an absolutely fascinating topic that should really be taught in school. Learn about
    1. [macronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition#Macronutrients): carbs, proteins, fats, as well as the
    2. [micronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition#Micronutrients): minerals and vitamins. Track your food composition for a week and make conscious adjustments.
3. *Sport*

   Find some sport that is fun for you, either solo or in a group. It needs to motivate you to engage in that sport at least twice a week.
4. *Growth*

   Try to recognize and take opportunities to leave your established comfort zone once a day.

If you read this you will either already have an idea which area you can work on, or you may feel that your particular problem is more complex...

You could think

* Well, I have always eaten whatever I wanted. My problem is that my job is stressful.
* Oh, I'm not a sports person. My problem is my relationship with my significant other.

If you feel this way, stop right there. That is not how this works. The reason that the Fundamental Four are fundamental is that they influence all aspects of your life. A lack in any of these areas will effectively show up as *some problem* in *some aspect* of your life.
